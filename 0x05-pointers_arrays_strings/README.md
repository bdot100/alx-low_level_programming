An array is a block of sequential data. 
Pointers (pointer variables) are special variables that are used to store addresses rather than values.

Pointer Syntax
Here is how we can declare pointers:

int* p;
=> Here, we have declared a pointer p of int type.

You can also declare pointers in these ways.
int *p1;
int * p2;
